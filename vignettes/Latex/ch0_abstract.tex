This paper introduces Semi Split-Plot designs. They are a new class of experimental designs amd supports factors where only a reduced number of factor settings can be applied inside of one block. An algorithm to generate optimal Semi Split-Plot designs is preseneted. A tutorial for the r-package \textbf{rospd} that implements the algorithm is given. Semi Split-Plot designs are compared to completly randomized and split-plot designs in terms of balance, aliasing and predictive quality.
