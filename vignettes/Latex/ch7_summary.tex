\section{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{summary}

We introduced the concept of semi-split-plot designs and semi-hard-to-change factors. An algorithm to generate optimal semi-split-plot designs was proposed. The implementation of this algorithm is available on Github \url{https://github.com/neuhier/rospd} and will be published on CRAN in the future. The current implementation is done mostly in R and the performance could be improved by changing to a C-implementation. 

The comparison of multiple design classes for the described use case showed that semi-split-plot designs can provide statistical qualities that are very comperable to the ones of CRDs. As CRDs are not feasible for this application the comparison to traditional split-plot designs is more relevant. The design evaluation showed that semi-split-plot designs can reduce the correlation of factors and whole plots. Thus they are preferable over split-plot designs with regard of statistical quality and feasibility.
