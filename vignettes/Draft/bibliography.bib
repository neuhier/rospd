  abstract = {Summary.  We introduce a new method for generating optimal split‐plot designs. These designs are optimal in the sense that they are efficient for estimating the fixed effects of the statistical model that is appropriate given the split‐plot design structure. One advantage of the method is that it does not require the prior specification of a candidate set. This makes the production of split‐plot designs computationally feasible in situations where the candidate set is too large to be tractable. The method allows for flexible choice of the sample size and supports inclusion of both continuous and categorical factors. The model can be any linear regression model and may include arbitrary polynomial terms in the continuous factors and interaction terms of any order. We demonstrate the usefulness of this flexibility with a 100‐run polypropylene experiment involving 11 factors where we found a design that is substantially more efficient than designs that are produced by using other approaches.}

  abstract={Response surface experiments often involve only quantitative factors, and the response is fit using a full quadratic model in these factors. The term response surface implies that interest in these studies is more on prediction than parameter estimation since the points on the fitted surface are predicted responses. When computing optimal designs for response surface experiments, it therefore makes sense to focus attention on the predictive capability of the designs. However, the most popular criterion for creating optimal experimental designs is the D-optimality criterion, which aims to minimize the variance of the factor-effect estimates in an omnibus sense. Because I-optimal designs minimize the average variance of prediction over the region of experimentation, their focus is clearly on prediction. Therefore, the I-optimality criterion seems to be a more appropriate one than the D-optimality criterion for generating response surface designs. Here, we introduce I-optimal design of split-plot response surface experiments. We show through several examples that I-optimal split-plot designs provide substantial benefits in terms of prediction compared to D-optimal split-plot designs, while also performing very well in terms of the precision of the factor-effect estimates.},
